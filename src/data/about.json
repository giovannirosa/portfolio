  "about": "Hi! I'm Gio, a passionate software engineer from Brazil with over 9 years of experience designing and developing modern, scalable web applications. My journey began with a deep curiosity about how systems work and grew into a career focused on creating smart, secure, and connected digital experiences. With a strong academic background—holding both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Computer Science from UFPR—my expertise lies in crafting full stack solutions using React, Node.js, Java, Python, and a range of modern frameworks. I've contributed to international and national projects across various industries, including aviation, healthcare, IoT, finance, and real estate, working with clients such as SITA, Schneider, Corvalent, and RCI Bank. Today, I run GRDS IT Services, where I build web platforms that connect to IoT devices, manage real-time data via MQTT, IoT Core, Aurora, and deploy cloud-native solutions on AWS and Azure. When I'm not writing code or solving architecture puzzles, I'm exploring my interests in IoT, machine learning, blockchain, and augmented reality—or just enjoying the latest breakthroughs in tech. Oh, and I also enjoy a little gaming on the side—keeps me sharp!",
